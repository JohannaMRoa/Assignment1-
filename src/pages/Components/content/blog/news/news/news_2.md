Collectors and Hendrix followers are buzzing online after the discovery of a reel-to-reel tape believed to contain unreleased demo recordings made in 1968. According to early reports, the material could include experimental versions of *Purple Haze*, *Drifting*, and an unknown jam session with guest musicians.

Audio specialists are currently restoring the tape due to age-related damage, and the Hendrix estate has not yet confirmed ownership or release plans. Still, digital leaks have sparked huge curiosity among superfans, some claiming the clips sound “raw, heavy, and very alive.”

If authenticated, the tracks could form part of a future deluxe anniversary album. Until then, the world waits eagerly — proof that Hendrix’s influence continues to echo across generations.
