Music fans may soon experience Jimi Hendrix like never before. A creative digital project titled *"Electric Voodoo Experience"* is planning to launch in 2025, featuring a full hologram performance of Hendrix supported by a live band. The show will include motion-captured guitar solos, reconstructed vocals, and immersive psychedelic visuals inspired by his original concerts.

Producers behind the project report that the tour will visit Seattle, London, and Tokyo, with the potential for festival appearances in late 2025. While some fans feel unsure about hologram ethics, others are excited to witness Hendrix’s iconic performances re-imagined for a new generation.

If the pilot shows succeed, organizers expect to expand the concept worldwide, creating what could become the most ambitious tribute to Hendrix to date.
