London is celebrating guitar culture with a new interactive Hendrix exhibit opening this spring. Unlike traditional museums, this installation invites visitors to pick up instruments, use iconic effects pedals like the Fuzz Face, and remix stems from original recordings to create their own track.

One room recreates Hendrix’s legendary Woodstock stage setup, complete with projection lights and responsive soundscapes. Another space allows fans to isolate vocals, delay guitars, or warp solos with AI tools designed for creative exploration.

The exhibit runs for six months and offers student discounted tickets, workshops, and evening jam sessions. Organizers hope it will inspire young musicians to explore psychedelic rock and continue Hendrix’s legacy through creativity.
